![Sample projection](sample_projection_diagram.svg)
This image shows projection of questions from tutoring system. For management of the problem pool, I wanted to display them in some way that can be naturally interpreted. This thread describes one way of doing so.

Each dot in the image represents one question, and its proximity to others represents how similar they are. E.g., question "b_ografie" is quite similar to "b_olog", but it is not similar to "zb_tek". #PCA #visualization #learning

For this I choose to utilize correctness of answers from users. We consider questions to be similar when they are answered similarly by users. But I want to know if similarity of questions can also be affected by structure of system.

![Similarity pipeline](pipeline_diagram.svg)
First I take data about user performance and compare each pair of questions using Pearson correlation coefficient. This yelds us square matrix containing similarity of all pairs of questions. After that I apply PCA to reduce this similarity matrix into a 2D projection.

Projection is representation of questions useful for visualizations for end users. Like image I showed. #diagram #matrix

Not all users answer all of the questions. On the contrary, performance matrix is relatively sparse. However, missing values are not distributed randomly, but they form a pattern.

My question was whether this pattern can affect similarity of questions and therefore projections.

Questions in the system are divided into up to three levels. The difficulty of the levels raises. Users in the system usually do not solve all of the levels. Less experienced users usually solve only first or first two levels. But, more experienced users solve only higher levels.

![Simulated data with missing answers](simulated_missing.png)
I simulated virtual users to create artificial data with about missing answers. Image shows projection such data. Colors of items represents their level. It is visible, that pattern of missing answers can affect similarity of questions. #PCA #visualization #simulation

I focused on this topic in my bachelor's thesis http://ienze.me/tmsei_thesis/ and I found that more factors affecting similarity of questions exists. If you are interested you can continue reading about them there.
